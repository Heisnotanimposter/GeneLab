The gene mutation process of experimental mice and compares their gene sequences with a target sequence. It uses the Hamming distance as a similarity score to measure how close the mutated sequences are to the target sequence. It runs multiple experiments with different parameters and reports the best score and sequence, as well as all the results.

Character Composition
First Character: Initially, the first character of a PDB ID was always a digit (0-9), which helped in organizing and indexing the database entries. This convention was sufficient in the early days of the PDB when the number of entries was relatively small. However, as the database grew rapidly, this convention evolved to include letters (A-Z) in the first position to increase the capacity of unique IDs that could be generated.

Next Three Characters: The remaining three characters can be any combination of digits (0-9) and letters (A-Z), providing the flexibility needed to generate a large number of unique identifiers. This mixture of letters and numbers helps in accommodating the ever-expanding repository of structural data.

Significance of the Structure
Scalability: The use of a four-character alphanumeric code allows for 36^4 (about 1.68 million) possible unique identifiers, accommodating the growth of the database.
Uniqueness: Each PDB ID uniquely identifies a single structure within the database, ensuring that researchers can precisely reference and access the structural data they need.
Simplicity: The relatively short length of the ID makes it easy to use and remember, facilitating quick access to specific structures of interest in the database.
Versatility: The inclusion of both letters and numbers in the ID provides a high degree of versatility in generating unique codes, which is crucial for a database that serves a global scientific community with diverse research needs.
Practical Implications
The design of the PDB ID system reflects a balance between simplicity for ease of use and the complexity needed to ensure uniqueness and scalability. As the database continues to grow, the PDB ID remains a crucial tool for the organization, retrieval, and reference of structural data in the scientific community.
