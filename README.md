# GeneLab

The gene mutation process of experimental mice and compares their gene sequences with a target sequence. It uses the Hamming distance as a similarity score to measure how close the mutated sequences are to the target sequence. It runs multiple experiments with different parameters and reports the best score and sequence, as well as all the results.
